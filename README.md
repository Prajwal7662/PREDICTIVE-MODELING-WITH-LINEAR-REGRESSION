Overview of the Project

Project: PREDICTIVE MODELING WITH LINEAR REGRESSION

Objective:
The objective of this project is to implement a simple linear regression model using a dataset with continuous target variables. This involves:

Loading and exploring the dataset

Splitting the data into training and testing sets

Training a linear regression model

Evaluating the model's performance

Making predictions on the test set

Visualizing the results to assess the model's accuracy


Key Activities:
Data Loading: Import and load the dataset using pandas.

Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.

Model Training: Train the linear regression model using the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like mean squared error and R-squared.

Predictions: Make predictions on the test set using the trained model.

Visualization: Visualize the regression line and the actual vs. predicted values to assess the model's accuracy.


Technologies Used:
Python: The programming language used for implementing the project.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

scikit-learn: For machine learning, specifically the LinearRegression model.

matplotlib: For data visualization to plot the regression line and actual vs. predicted values.

numpy
