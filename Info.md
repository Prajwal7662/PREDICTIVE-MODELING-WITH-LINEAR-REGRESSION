📈 Predictive Modeling with Linear Regression

📌 Introduction

This project demonstrates how to build a predictive model using Linear Regression.
Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning, used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features).

The goal of this project is to train, evaluate, and interpret a linear regression model for predictive tasks.


🎯 Objectives

Understand the concept of Linear Regression.

Implement Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using Python (Scikit-learn).

Evaluate model performance using metrics like R² Score, MSE, RMSE, and MAE.

Visualize predictions vs actual values.

Apply the model for predictive analytics.

🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

pandas → Data manipulation

numpy → Numerical computations

matplotlib & seaborn → Data visualization

scikit-learn → Machine Learning model & evaluation

📊 Methodology

Data Collection – Load dataset (CSV/Excel or built-in datasets).

Data Preprocessing – Handle missing values, outliers, and feature scaling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Use statistical and visual analysis.

Model Building – Apply Linear Regression algorithm.

📈 Evaluation Metrics

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

R² Score

📚 Applications

Forecasting sales or demand.

Predicting stock/house prices.

Estimating costs or profits.

Any task involving continuous value prediction.
